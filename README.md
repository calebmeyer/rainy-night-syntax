==================

A dark and blue syntax theme for the atom editor

This theme is still a work in progress. Highlighting for line numbers was adapted from [the ninja syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/ninja-syntax)

Spec files are partially adapted from [the duotone dark syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/duotone-dark-syntax)
